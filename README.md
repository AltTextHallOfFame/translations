# Translating Alt Text Hall of Fame

[Alt Text Hall of Fame](https://alttexthalloffame.org/) is a fairly simple, one-page [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) site. It uses the [Twenty Twenty-Three WordPress theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentythree/), the [Fediverse Embeds](https://wordpress.org/plugins/fediverse-embeds/) plugin to embed Mastodon posts, and the [Polylang](https://wordpress.org/plugins/polylang/) plugin to manage translations.

## Translation workflow

## Site admin

1. [Add new language.](https://alttexthalloffame.org/wp-admin/admin.php?page=mlang)
2. [Add new translation](https://alttexthalloffame.org/wp-admin/post.php?post=2&action=edit) (see sidebar under "Languages"), save the new page as a draft.
3. Copy the content of the original home page into the new draft page.
4. Create a new account for the translator.
5. Assign the draft translation page to the translator.

## Translator

After logging in, you can [view translations that have been assigned to you](https://alttexthalloffame.org/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=page).

A few things to keep in mind.

1. You don't have to translate everything to the word. Be natural, use common expressions and cultural references from your language. 
2. Keep things simple, positive, and respectful. The goal is to show the positive side of describing images we share online and encourage doing this.
